This IRC bot is intended for users familiar with Python.

This is simply an object-oriented implementation of an IRC bot using Twisted.


To build an IRC bot which sends messages based on those it receives, one can
simply modify the ExampleCommandHanderFactory. This is done by mapping one or
more regular expressions to one or more functions which are be executed when
a message evaluating true on the keyed regular expression is received.

To build a more complex bot, modifications to the ExampleCommandHandler may be
necessary. Such modifications might include allowing filtering of messages
beyond simply whether they are sent directly to the bot or not.


To run directy, ircBot.py must be updated to specify the desired configuration.

To run from another Python application, ircBot.py serves as example invocation.
